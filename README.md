# SalesAnalysis

This project analyzes sales data from multiple stores.  
It calculates totals, averages, maximum and minimum sales for stores and products.

## How to use

1. Put your sales data in the `salesData.txt` file (each row = store, columns = products).  
2. Run the `SalesAnalysis` Java program. It reads the data from the file and shows:  
   - Total sales per store  
   - Average sales per store and product  
   - Highest and lowest individual product sales
